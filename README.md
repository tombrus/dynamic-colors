dynamic-colors
==============

JQuery extension to dynamically adjust colors on a page:
  - define what colors are changeable in your css
  - init DynamicColors and pass in a div for the color controls
  - the color controls div will contain a list of color pickers that
    allow you to dynamically adjust the colors
  - changed colors are saved in a cookie, so they re-appear at reload
  - you can copy the color settings from a text field to tell someone
    else to rate or enjoy it
    
Can be helpful while developing a proper color scheme (or schemes).
You can also empower your users to tweak some colors to their liking.
